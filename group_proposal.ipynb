    "-  ***Expected Outcomes and Significance***\n",
    "\n",
    "      -   We believe that studying related objects is beneficial to students as this can strengthen their understanding of students about the goal object as there is a connection between related objects and goal objects. In addition, we also believe that there is a positive relationship between the number of repetition study of users with the goal object materials and their exam performance. Thus, we have 3 expectations: students who study related object materials and goal object materials will perform better than those who only study goal object materials. The higher the degree of study time, the better the exam performance of students. The higher the number of repetition study with the materials, the better the exam performance of students. \n",
    "\n",
    "      - The findings can contribute to the research area of education. In the future, researchers can further improve the quality of education and student learning experience by designing better study habits for students based on the conclusions of the findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "      - Our findings lead to further research questions like if students have a better learning experience by studying/ majoring in 2 related/ similar areas (e.g. Chemistry and Physics or English Literature and History) at the same time.  \n"
